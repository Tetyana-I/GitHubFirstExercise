Part I
Create a local repository and add and commit some files:

    mkdir github_exercise
    cd github_exercise
    git init
    touch github_exercise.html app.css github.txt
    git add .  
    git commit -m "added github exercise files"

Create a remote repository and push your code from the local repo to the remote:

Create a local branch and add and commit some files
Push that local branch to GitHub to create a remote branch
Part II - Put your memory game on GitHub pages
Using GitHub pages, deploy your memory game from the previous unit so that you can share them with anyone!
